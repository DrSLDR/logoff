## Features:

- A functioning testing framework (v0.1)
- Input parsing (v0.2)

## Planned features:

- Top-down proof-tree construction
- Proof-tree verification
- Bottom-up proof derivation
- MILL homomorphism

## ToDo:

- [ ] Datatype setup
  - [x] Fundamental LGf datatypes
  - [ ] Proof-tree representation
  - [ ] Lexicon representation
- [x] Testing framework
  - [x] Fundamental testcases
  - [x] Verbose testing output
  - [x] "Easily" extensible framework
- [x] Travis integration
- [ ] Input/Output
  - [x] Nicely formated output
  - [x] Input parsing
    - [ ] A (QuickCheck) testing suite for the parser (_an exercise for the reader_)
- [ ] Top-down proofing algorithm
- There will be more...
